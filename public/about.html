    <h1>About OpenShift Dedicated Demo 1.0.0</h1>

    <p>
        This application is a simple Node.js application that is expected to run in a
        container deployed by OpenShift.  It was created to help explore OpenShift Dedicated
        by allowing the user to write messages to the log, crash the application, and even
        create and view files in a shared file system.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project build's on a similar project by IBM, <a href="https://github.com/IBM-ICP-CoC/KubeToy">KubeToy</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This app uses Bootstrap 4 and some custom styling. All the files have been copied locally to this
        application so Internet connectivity is not required and can work in an air-gapped system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The app was written by Jim Conallen &lt;jconallen@us.ibm.com&gt; and updated with custom OpenShift
        functionality by Will Gordon &lt;wgordon@redhat.com&gt;. The app is made available under the
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>. If you find any bugs, create an
        issue on the <a href="https://github.com/openshift-cs/openshift-dedicated-demo/issues">GitHub site</a>, and
        we'll do what we can to address them.
